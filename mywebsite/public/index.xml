      <description>I am a software engineer and problem solver from Sydney, Australia.&#xA;As an undergrad, I studied at the University of New South Wales, in a Bachelor of Computer Engineering (Hons). I have been on the Dean&amp;rsquo;s Honour&amp;rsquo;s list, and maintained an HD-average. I was recently awarded the &amp;lsquo;Brightest Minds&amp;rsquo; full scholarship for postgraduate studies at UNSW. My academic work covered many topics in computer science, focussing on both software and hardware design.</description>
