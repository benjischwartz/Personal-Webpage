* **CellSim:** Full-stack development of a web-hosted editing and visualization tool for CellML models. Client-server architecture (backend in C++using Mongoose, frontend with VueJS). [Repository](https://github.com/benjischwartz/CellSim).

* **Custom Rust Interpreter:** As part of my univerisity studies, I build an interpreter for the Logo language in Rust. [Repository](https://github.com/benjischwartz/COMP6991/tree/main/ass1).

* **Zipf's Law:** A project to validate the rank-frequency distribution of the English language, given a large enough sample of text. This python program starts at the Wikipedia page for "Team sport" and follows the first link in each page, provided it has not been visited before. It then collates all the text, creating a word-frequency dictionary which can then be plotted. [Repository](https://github.com/benjischwartz/zipf).

* **Messaging Platform:** Contributed to the back-end development of a messaging platform simulating popular scrum platform 'Flock'. API functionality includes user registration, messaging, message 'pinning' and 'reacting', channel creation and data persistence. [Repository](https://github.com/benjischwartz/flockr).

* **File compression:** Functioning file compressing using a structure similar to zipfiles called 'blobs'. [Repository](https://github.com/benjischwartz/blobby_file_compressor).
