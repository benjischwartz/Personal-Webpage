I am a software engineer and problem solver from Sydney, Australia.

I am studying at [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/), and will graduate with a Bachelor of Computer Engineering (Hons). I have been on the Dean's Honour's list, and maintained an HD-average. I was recently awarded the 'Brightest Minds' full scholarship for postgraduate studies at UNSW. My academic work covered many topics in computer science, focussing on both software and hardware design.

I have recently completed an internship with [IMC Trading](https://www.imc.com/ap/) where I worked in C++ as part of the execution team. I have also worked as Software Engineer for Transpara and managed their CRM platform. I worked as a Data Analytics Intern for [Quantium](https://quantium.com/) and for several years as an academic tutor for the [Lindfield Learning Hub](https://www.lindfieldlearninghub.com.au/). 

I am interested in many topics including Math, Data Analytics and Networking. I'm experienced with C++, Java, and Go, and recently have been learning Rust as well as front-end development.

Feel free to check out out some of my [projects](/projects).
