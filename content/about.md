I'm Benji. I'm a software engineer from Sydney, Australia. Here's my [CV.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WfI-IznNBwUbZOG3TQgfSZtf_xnPIRJi/view?usp=sharing)

I've just graduated with from [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/), with a Bachelor of Computer Engineering with First Class Honours, and an HD-Average. I was recently awarded the 'Brightest Minds' full scholarship for postgraduate studies at UNSW. My academic work covered many topics in computer science, focussing on both software and hardware design.

I'm primarily a backend/systems dev. I'm most competent in C++ but am also proficient in Rust, Java, and Go. I've built full-stack applications with Vue.Js. I've done several internships including [IMC Trading](https://www.imc.com/ap/) - working on the trading system's C++ execution framework, and [Quantium](https://quantium.com/) - working as a data analyst in Python and SQL. I've also worked for several years as an academic tutor both privately and for the [Lindfield Learning Hub](https://www.lindfieldlearninghub.com.au/). 

I've also done several side projects include a full-stack editing and visualization tool for CellML models, a rust-based multi-threaded spreadsheet, and a CNN Accelerator on an FPGA. Feel free to check out some of my [projects](/projects), as well as some [topics](/notes) I've been learning about.

I enjoy solving really difficult problems. I'm currently incredibly excited by AI, data science, robotics and infrastructure.
